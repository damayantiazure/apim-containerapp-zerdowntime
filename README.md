# Introduction

This repository demonstrates how to create .net backend that talks to Azure DevOps, built in a container and hosted on ACA, network joined, exposed via APIM (also network joined as external mode) and finally with a policy that validates the JWT tokens before the requestes get forwarded to the upstream. 

Mode details can be found here: https://moimhossain.com/2023/07/24/secure-api-with-api-management-network-integrated-container-apps/
